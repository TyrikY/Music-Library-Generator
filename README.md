# Music-Library-Generator
This program would allow users to manage a digital library stored in a text file.
  a. Features -
    i. Add new music tracks to the library
    ii. Delete existing tracks from the library
    iii. Update information about existing tracks (e.g., title, artist, album, genre, duration)
    iv. Search the library by various criteria (e.g., artist, album, genre, duration)
    v. Generate reports and statistics about the music library (e.g., total number of tracks, top artists, most popular genres)
    vi. Export the entire library or a subset of tracks to a new text file
  b. Data Structure -
    i. The music library data would be stored in a text file, with each track represented by a line containing the track information (e.g., title, artist, album, genre, duration) separated by a delimiter like a comma or tab
    ii. In the program, I would use a list of dictionaries to represent the music tracks, where each dictionary contains the track data. This would allow you to easily add, remove, and update tracks.
